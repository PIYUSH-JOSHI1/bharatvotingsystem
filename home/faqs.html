                <div class="faq-question">What is the QR-based verification system?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The QR-based verification system is an advanced technological solution implemented by the Election Commission of India to streamline the voter verification process. Each registered voter receives a unique QR code that contains encrypted information about their identity and voting eligibility. At the polling booth, this QR code is scanned using specialized equipment, which instantly verifies the voter's identity against the central database, significantly reducing waiting times and enhancing security.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-question">How do I register for QR code-based voting?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>To register for QR code-based voting, follow these steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Visit the Bharat Voting System website and click on "Register"</li>
                        <li>Fill in your personal details and voter ID information</li>
                        <li>Upload the required identity documents for verification</li>
                        <li>Set up a secure password for your account</li>
                        <li>Complete the verification process which may include an OTP sent to your registered mobile number</li>
                        <li>Once your identity is verified, a unique QR code will be generated</li>
                        <li>You can download and print this QR code or save it on your mobile device for use during voting</li>
                    </ol>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Is the QR code system secure?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, the QR code system implements multiple layers of security to protect voter information and maintain the integrity of the electoral process:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>End-to-end encryption:</strong> All data in the QR code is encrypted using advanced cryptographic techniques</li>
                        <li><strong>Tamper-proof design:</strong> The QR codes contain digital signatures that make them impossible to forge or alter</li>
                        <li><strong>Biometric integration:</strong> The system cross-verifies QR code data with biometric details (like fingerprints or facial recognition) at polling stations</li>
                        <li><strong>One-time use:</strong> Each QR code can only be used once for voting, preventing duplicate votes</li>
                        <li><strong>Offline verification capability:</strong> The system can verify voters even without an internet connection at polling booths</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The system has undergone rigorous security audits by independent cybersecurity experts and has been certified by regulatory authorities.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What should I do if I lose my QR code?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If you lose your QR code, don't worry. You can follow these steps to retrieve it:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Log in to your account on the Bharat Voting System website using your registered credentials</li>
                        <li>Navigate to the "My Profile" or "My QR Code" section</li>
                        <li>Select the option to "Regenerate QR Code"</li>
                        <li>Verify your identity through an OTP sent to your registered mobile number</li>
                        <li>Download and print the new QR code</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Alternatively, you can visit your nearest Election Commission office with your voter ID and other identification documents to get assistance in regenerating your QR code. Please note that for security reasons, the old QR code will be invalidated once a new one is generated.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, you can still vote without a QR code. The QR code system is implemented to enhance convenience and reduce waiting times, but it is not mandatory for all voters during this transition phase.</p>
                    <p>If you don't have a QR code, you can still vote using the traditional method:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Visit your designated polling booth with your valid voter ID card</li>
                        <li>Wait in the regular line for manual verification</li>
                        <li>The polling officer will verify your identity against the electoral roll</li>
                        <li>Once verified, you will be allowed to cast your vote</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>However, we encourage all voters to register for the QR code system as it significantly reduces waiting times and enhances the overall voting experience.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">How long are the waiting times with the QR code system?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>With the QR code system, average waiting times have been significantly reduced. Based on data from recent elections where the system was piloted:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Average verification time per voter: 15-20 seconds (compared to 3-5 minutes with traditional methods)</li>
                        <li>Average waiting time during peak hours: 10-15 minutes (compared to 1-2 hours previously)</li>
                        <li>Overall reduction in waiting times: Approximately 75-80%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These timings may vary based on voter turnout, booth infrastructure, and local conditions. The Booth Locator feature on our website and mobile app provides real-time information about estimated waiting times at different polling booths, allowing voters to plan their visit accordingly.</p>
